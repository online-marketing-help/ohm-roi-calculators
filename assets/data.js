/* =========================================================================
   Everything the calculator is allowed to assume lives here.

   Two rules this file follows.

   1. OMH's prices are facts. They come from the price breakdown agreed with
      the MD and must not be edited here to make a number look better.

   2. Industry figures are NOT facts, they are starting points. Every default
      carries the source it came from and how much weight that source deserves.
      Most "missed call" statistics in this market are vendor marketing with no
      traceable study behind them, so the honest thing is to say so, show the
      owner the number, and let them replace it with their own.
